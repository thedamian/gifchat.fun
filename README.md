# GIPHY Chat

Yes it's stupid. and YES it's fun!

To get it running locally you'll need a <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">Giphy API</a> and put that into a .env file. You have a .env.example file as an example.

Then you'll need the /build directory from the front end so follow these instructions from the root of this repo

```
cd client
npm i
npm run build
cd ../server
npm i
npm run dev
```
Now you'll have a single website (as opposed to a client and server) at <a href="http://localhost:5017">http://localhost:5017</a> and ENJOY!

and YES you can see it on https://gifchat.fun 

You're welcome!
